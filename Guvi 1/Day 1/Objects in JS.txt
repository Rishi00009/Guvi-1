Javascript is a object-oriented program.In javascript every thing is a object.these  objects are defined as unordered collection of related data, that are of reference type.These are defined in the form of key:value pairs.These keys are variables or functions which are called as properties and methods of an objects.In objects every data stored in alphabetical order. we can call a value via its key or variable.Javascript engines use various data structures to represent objects efficiently.one common approach is using a hash table ora similar structure to store the objects properties and their corresponding values.this allows for fast access and manipulation of properties.
